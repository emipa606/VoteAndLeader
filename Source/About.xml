  <description># A new leader is elected every 60 days.
Pawns vote carefully according to social skill, intimacy, family relationship, romantic relationship, same and different ideology, and criminal status.
Two days after a leader is elected, the leader will assign whoever he wants to the position.
You can no longer manually assign positions to pawns.
