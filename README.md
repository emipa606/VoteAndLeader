# **# A new leader is elected every 60 days. (can change in option)**


**- Pawns vote carefully according to pawn's ideoligion, social skill, intimacy, family relationship, romantic relationship, same or different ideology, and criminal status.

- Two days after a leader is elected, The leader will assign the desired person to the remaining positions.
(or, you can use the leader's assign roles ability to assign immediately.)

- You can no longer manually assign positions to pawns.

- The first voting will take place after the 15th. (need 3 colonists)

- The number of available votes for pawns increases according to the leader's ideoligion.**
